# [Mini Project 1: Adidas Sales Prediction Using Machine Learning](https://github.com/Josephmathew882/Project-1-Adidas-Sales-Prediction-)

Aim of this  project is to predict the total sales of global brand Adidas in each transactions by processing its dataset using suitable Machine Learning algorithm.

* Data             - Data set is taken from Kaggle and this dataset include details such as the number of units sold, the total sales, the location of the sales, the 
                     type of product sold, and other relevant information.
* Technique Used   -  The target value in this dataset is continous so to anlyse this data we should use regression methods
* Processes Used   - Data Cleaning, Data Visualization, Cross Validation, Hypertunning and Prediction
* Algorithms Used  - Random Forest Regressor, Linear Regressor, K-Neighbours Regressor, Support Vector Regressor
* Conclusion       - From the cross validation analysis it is evident that Random Forest Regressor is best suitable algorithm for the given data set and using Random 
                      Forest Regressor Model we predicted the target values which is total sales of Adidas product with a model score of 99.9%.

# [Accenture-Data-Analytics-and-Visualization-Job-Simulation](https://github.com/Josephmathew882/Accenture-Data-Analytics-and-Visualization-Job-Simulation)
This project includes understanding of client data, data cleaning and modeling, data visualization and presentation.
## Task - 1
## Project Understanding

* One of Accenture’s Managing Directors, Mae Mulligan, is the client lead for Social Buzz.
  
* She has reviewed the brief provided by Social Buzz and has assembled a diverse team of Accenture experts to deliver the project.
  
* Mae has scheduled a project kick off call with the internal Accenture project team for tomorrow morning.

  The client wanted to see “An analysis of their content categories showing the top 5 categories with the largest popularity”.

  
About Client: [Social Buzz](https://github.com/Josephmathew882/Accenture-Data-Analytics-and-Visualization-Job-Simulation/blob/main/Data_Analytics%20Client%20Brief%20(1).pdf)

## Task - 2
## Data Cleaning 

* Removing rows that have values which have no values.
* Changing the data type of some values within a column.
* Removing columns which are not relevant to this task.
  
## Data Modeling
 From the all the datasets given we have used ReactionTypes, Reactions and Content data sets.
 
 We created a final dataset by merging these three datasets with use of power query and identified the top 5 categories which have higher popularity.

## Task - 3
## Data Visualiztion and Storytelling 
Make the Powerpoint presentation for the client to give insights and recomendations
